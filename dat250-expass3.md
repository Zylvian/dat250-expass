Idea:
- As a company shoud ship out orders based on the date ordered (first orders first), having a simple map-reduce for sorting the dates of when the orders came in seems like a good idea. The dates could be ordered in a more readable format, but the dates are in the correct order per now.

Pending issues:
- None.
