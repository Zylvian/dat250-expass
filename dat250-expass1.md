## Technical problems:

1) I had an issue getting the program to compile with Maven, even after updating the latest Java JDK. This turned out to be due to the newer installations
of Java not updating the JAVA_HOME environment variable. After updating this, mvn could correctly compile the software.

## Validation

1) I used "heroku run java -version" to make sure that my application was running the correct Java version, and I checked both a local and remotely deployed version to make sure 
I had completed the goals in the tutorial.

## Heroku issues

1) I had zero issues with the platform itself, everything went smoothtly. 

## Unsolved issues

1) I did not complete the add-on step as it required me to verify myself with a credit card, which I didn't feel like doing at this point.
